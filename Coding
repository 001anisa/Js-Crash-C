Given an array of integers (nums), your task is to find the single element that appears only once in the array. All the other elements appear twice in the array.solve in linear time.
solution:
     /**
 * @param {number[]} nums
 * @return {number}
 */

export function singleNumber(nums) {
    let result=0
        for(const i of nums)
        {
           result^=i
        }
        return result
}

//hover count in react 
import { useState } from "react"

const App = () => {
	// Edit this component
    const [count,setCount] =useState(0)
    
    const handleHover=()=>
    {
        setCount(count+1)
    }
    
	return (
		<div>
			<button data-testid="button" onMouseOver={handleHover}>Hover Me</button>
			<h1 data-testid="count">{count}</h1>
		</div>
	)
}

export default App

Explanation:
useState(0) - This is a call to the useState hook. The useState hook is a built-in React hook that allows functional components to manage state. It takes an initial state value as its argument. In this case, the initial state value is 0, meaning we're initializing the count state variable with a value of 0.
const [count, setCount] - This line uses destructuring assignment to declare two variables: count and setCount. These names are arbitrary and can be chosen as you like, but they are commonly used to describe a state variable and a function to update that state variable.
count is the current value of the state variable. It holds the current state of your component.
setCount is a function that allows you to update the state variable count. When you call setCount(newValue), it updates the count to newValue, and React re-renders the component with the new state.


// find a missing number from array
export const missingNumber = function (nums) {
    let temp = (nums.length*(nums.length+1))/2;
    let total = nums.reduce((a,i)=> a+i,0);  //def is given below
    
    return temp-total;
}
Syntax:
array.reduce(function(total, currentValue, currentIndex, arr), initialValue)
